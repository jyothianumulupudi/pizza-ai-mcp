🍕 Mission: Make Pizza AI-Ready

Imagine a world where ordering a pizza no longer requires clicking buttons, scrolling menus, or filling forms.
Instead, you simply say what you want — and intelligent systems take care of the rest.

This project is built around that idea.

“Mission: Make Pizza AI-Ready” is not just about pizzas; it’s about preparing everyday applications for a future where AI agents become the primary users. As human interaction shifts from screens to conversations, software systems must evolve from UI-centric designs to agent-centric architectures.

In this system, the pizza backend speaks a language that AI agents understand. Menus are structured, pricing rules are predictable, and responses are designed to be consumed by machines as easily as by humans. Natural language requests are transformed into precise actions, and each order carries clear context such as price, size, and estimated preparation time.

The application demonstrates how traditional APIs can be reimagined as AI-ready services. A lightweight backend handles business logic, an ordering agent interprets intent, and a coordination-ready architecture enables future agent-to-agent workflows. Even the user interface is intentionally kept minimal — not as the centerpiece, but as a window into how AI agents already interact with the system behind the scenes.

This project represents a shift in thinking:
from building applications for users,
to building systems for intelligent agents.

The goal is not complexity, but clarity.
Not heavy infrastructure, but thoughtful design.
Not just ordering pizza — but enabling the next interface layer of software.
